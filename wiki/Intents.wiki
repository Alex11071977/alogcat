#aLogcat Intent definition

aLogcat accepts the following intents,

==org.jtb.alogcat.intent.START==

This starts the application. The following extras are supported,

===FILTER===

Sets aLogcat's filter value. Value is interpreted as a string if substring filter mode is in effect, or as a regular expression otherwise. Again, the regular expression string value must be Java conforming (it needs to be properly escaped).

===LEVEL===

Sets aLogcat's level. Value can be one of: V, D, I, W, or E.


==org.jtb.alogcat.intent.SAVE==

Triggers aLogcat to immediately write a log snapshot to /sdcard/alogcat. This intent accepts the same extras a the START intent, with the same semantics.
